# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-in-Javascript
This Project deals with the development of a Tic Tac Toe game also known as noughts and crosses for British English for two players, X and O, who take turns filling the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid (2D Array in JavaScript). The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
